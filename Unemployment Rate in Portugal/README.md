<h1>Unemployment Rate in Portugal: Time Series Analysis</h1> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In order to make accurate predictions it is imperative that we have a good perception of the country's economic growth. The unemployment rate is the most used indicator for understanding conditions in the labour market. It is measured by the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the labour force (the total number of people employed added to those unemployed). It is important to note that this is a lagging indicator, meaning that it generally rises or falls in the wake of changing economic conditions, rather than anticipating them. When the economy is in poor shape and jobs are scarce, the unemployment rate can be expected to rise. When the economy is growing at a healthy rate and jobs are relatively plentiful, it can be expected to fall (Anderson, Sommer. Clarine, Skylar. 2021). With that said, this poster focuses on the interpretation and forecast of the time series of unemployment rate in Portugal between 1999 and 2021 and its possible trends, seasonality, long-run cycles, variance, outliers, and abrupt changes that could impact the analysis, in order to accurately forecast the next four years of data using the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model. Since the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of the economic perspective, this project aims to understand how the economic perspective affects the time series under study using the periodogram and cross-correlation functions. The economic perspective consists of a set of analytical and econometric forecasts for carrying out estimates and evaluations of current and future economic indicators. The analysis was done in R, and both time series studied in this project are available on the INE (Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica) website.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
This project is part of the Master's Program in Statistics at @NovaIms, where we were challenged to do an end-to-end time series analysis project, including forecasting.<br> 

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
- R (programming language)
- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model
- Cross-Correlation
- Periodogram
